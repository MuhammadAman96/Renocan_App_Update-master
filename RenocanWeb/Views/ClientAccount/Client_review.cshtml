                                          The main reason I ended up using this company is because they were able to come on short notice and the plumber would review work with me and take instructions from me over the phone (other companies insisted I be at home, and would not accept our nanny being there). The work was also well done. That kind of service is hard to find. But it comes at a cost - they are definitely not cheap. Having said that, I will still use them again because I think their service is worth the cost.
